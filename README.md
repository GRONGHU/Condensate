# Condensate
This repository contains simulation files and analysis scripts for the manuscript "Protein Condensates Sustain Protein Dynamics and Delay Aging by Water-Mediated Non-equilibrium Energy Influx" by Guorong Hu et al.

The deposit includes all-atom condensate conformations (multi-frame .gro files) and GROMACS run input files (.tpr) for all independent replicates. Additionally, we provide the force field files and analysis scripts used to generate the results in the main text.

Please note that the complete simulation trajectories (which include explicit water molecules) are not hosted here due to their prohibitive size. All other data supporting the findings of this study are available from the corresponding authors upon request.
