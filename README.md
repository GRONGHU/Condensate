# Condensate
The data accompanying the manuscript "Protein Condensates Sustain Protein Dynamics and Delay Aging by Water-Mediated Non-equilibrium Energy Influx" (Guorong Hu et al.) are presented here. 

This deposit comprises the underlying all-atom simulation data, including condensate conformations (multi-frame .gro files) and GROMACS run input files (.tpr) for all independent all-atom simulations. The full simulation trajectories containing water molecules are not included due to their substantial size. Any further datasets or analysis tools pertinent to the conclusions of this paper can be obtained by contacting the corresponding authors.
